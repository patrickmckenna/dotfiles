My simplified, incomplete dotfiles. They borrow heavily from the [examples many others](https://dotfiles.github.io/), especially Mike McQuaid's [(far more complete) setup](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles).

Note: I also assume that I'd use Mike's [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) first before running this on any new machine.
